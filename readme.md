# Code Dojo
A gamified social learning web application for computer scienceâ€”like a mix of Kahoot and LeetCode.

Teachers can create quiz rooms with coding questions that students can answer in real-time.
Students can fill in solutions to coding problems and verify their answers locally.
Once completed, students can submit their answers, which get automatically graded.
