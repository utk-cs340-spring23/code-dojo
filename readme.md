## Overview
This product is an educational tool that resembles a combination of Kahoot and leetcode.
The teacher creates a “room” which students can join using a six-digit code.
The teacher can write code, updating in real time across students’ devices (like Google Docs).
There will also be an output section, so users can run/compile the code any time.
The teacher can also turn on “Question mode”, which gives the students a coding prompt that requires them to fill in a solution (similar to LeetCode or topcoder).
Students will be able to verify their answers locally, then submit their answers to the teacher.
Each student gets graded on their answers, and their grades are summed to a leader board like Kahoot.
