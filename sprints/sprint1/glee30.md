### What I accomplished
I created the main question page and added functionality for an animated sidebar that pulls out from the side. I setup the initial headings to what pages it would eventually link to. I also added buttons to the page that will be used in future sprints to add a note, submit, and run the code from the student's answers. I also made the text-boxes resizable based on the browser size so that it maintains a clean aesthetic on different machines and different monitors that users may have.
