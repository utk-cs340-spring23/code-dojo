### What you accomplished
<!-- (Give a description of the features you added or tasks you accomplished. Provide some detail here. This section will be a little longer than the bulleted lists above) -->
- Created a big screen page that is for the teacher to put on the projector for the class with the quesiton, time, and session ID.
- On the big screen page I added a graph API that is going to show the data of the class answers from multiple choice questions.
- On the teacher page it looked like all the fields the teacher needed to fill out were out of place so I added them into a flex box so that all of the fields looked like they were together like they are supposed to be. Made it so that the size varies based on which question type is selected.
- Made it so that the theme can be changed on the code editor
- Added the code editor to the teacher page - when it that type of question is selected. I also made it so that the teacher can select a language and theme from a drop down menu.
