# Sprint 4
- **Name:** Nagendra Upadhyay
- **github id:** nupadhy3
- **group name:** code-dojo

### What you planned to do
- I had planned to work on making the website be able to fit a mobile screen, so basically resize the contents and show them on a less pixelated screen. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/105
- I had planned to work on adding some colors, animations, and translations. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/104
- I had planned to add a button which would close the session when clicked. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/113
- I had planned to work on an idea which would help the students be able to see the questions that the teacher asked during a session, so I thought on working on a summary page. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/106
- I had planned to work with Alex to be able to show a summary of questions to the student as soon as the teacher closes the session. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/107

### What you did not do
- The only thing which I was not able to accomplish was to be able to push the summary page to the student from the database. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/107

### What problems you encountered
- The adding of the "close session" button and some other style changes were not bad. The only problem that I faced that gave me a hard time was that I was trying to pull data from the backend of each individual student. I wanted a summary which would show up on the studetn screen with questions asked, what they answered, and the correct asnwer. I was not able to pull the answer from the backend and decided to work with Alex, but that did not workout.

### What you accomplished
- I was sucessfully able to add the button to close the session. I also added a pop up box which would ask the teacher if they are sure about closing the session.
