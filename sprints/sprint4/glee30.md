### What I accomplished
This sprint, I worked with the group to flesh out a lot of features to get ready for sprint 5. I worked on some small things like button adjustments and other styling adjustments, but the biggest functionality that I implemented, was the PDF download from the teacher page. This required making a separate page that will later get info from the server, then adding js code to the teacher page to get and download that pdf page. This felt like a huge accomplishment because it involved using an api as well as html, css, and js and I enjoyed doing it.
