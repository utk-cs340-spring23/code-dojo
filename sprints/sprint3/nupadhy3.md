# Sprint 3
- **Name:** Nagendra Upadhyay
- **github id:** nupadhy3
- **group name:** code-dojo

### What you planned to do
- I had planned to make a multiple choice part for our website. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/77
- I had planned to also make a 'next question' button which would basically give the user a chance to make a new question in the website. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/78
- I had plans to make the page look nicer with color and necessary pop up boxes. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/80
- I also had planned to make a result page which would give the user the number of points they got. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/81
- I had also planned to add a timer space on the top right so the person can know the time left on the quiz.

### What you did not do
- The only thing which I was not able to accomplish was to get the multiple choice connected to the backend with my team.

### What problems you encountered
- The first problem that I encountered was with setting up the mcq page and adding a button to help add a new question to the list of questions. The problem was that the question which was being made was basically made by asking the user for the question, options, and correct answer via the pop up alert boxes. The idea that I wanted to apply was to somehow make a framework of a question with blanks and I would give the user a chance to fill up the question field and options. That idea did not work out, so I decided to take a new approach anf just make the frontend of how the quiz would look like.

### What you accomplished
- I succesfully made the frontend of the quiz. For now me and my team have decide we would just got with one multiple choice question being pushed to the student from the teachers server. I also added the timer part and result page succesfully. I also made some functions to check if the student has selected any options and if not push an alert message. I also added functions to give the user the chance to select or unselect an option. I also made the code in a way that would change the selected option to the one the user clicked after. I made the page look nicer with a green and white theme, but of course will change the colors to match the theme of the website as a whole.
