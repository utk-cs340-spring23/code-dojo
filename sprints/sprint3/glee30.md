### What I accomplished
This sprint I got a lot accomplished. I worked on a lot of this sprint alongside Alex and Harrison since the first step was connecting the back and front end. I worked with them to change some ids and layout around to match everything up and allow the server to work, as well as fix a lot of the css styling that got thrown off upon integration. I also worked with the group to get the coding textbox added. I helped Harrison to implement the about us form and complete some parts of the notes page. I also implemented color changes for the feedback to further show if a student has answered a question correctly and added a ninja slash animation upon a correct answer.
