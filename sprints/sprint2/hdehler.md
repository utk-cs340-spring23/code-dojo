- Make it so grid gets bigger per new student https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/50

### What you did not do
- Make it so tab does not bring you out of text box https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/19

### What problems you encountered
I was trying to link Alex's fully-synchronous timer and it was much harder than anticipated. I have the basis setup currently so that we can get the path and hopefully connect it properly along with the input from teh teacher page so that the timer is the correect time that the teacher set it to be.
