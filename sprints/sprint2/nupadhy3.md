# Sprint 2
- **Name:** Nagendra Upadhyay
- **github id:** nupadhy3
- **group name:** code-dojo

### What you planned to do
- I wanted to redesign my login website code to be more matched to the website theme. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/60
- I had plan to learn and work on making a database server to store the user login data. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/59
- I had plan on making a code to be able to store the user login data into a database, so the user can access it with theit login info. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/58
- I had planned to make a login and register account page and also had plans to make the code be done with alerts and checks. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/61

### What you did not do
- The only thing which I was not able to accomplish was to get the server working properly. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/58

### What problems you encountered
I decided to redesign the pages and I was having problems with getting the theme and switching the pages correctly. I also faced a lot of problems with database server which I was trying to learn to be able to store all the user info so they can login and logoff. The problems were becuase of data not getting pushed in and as a result the code that I wrote to get data from the server compare it to the person's email and passwrod for them to be able to login did not work. I almost have the framework finished of the login system but still trying to fix it.

### What you accomplished
- I succesfully redesiged the webpages to match the theme of the website as a whole. Added some good transitions and userinput trasntitions. Succesfully made a server and learned how to use it for pushing data and accessing data. Made alert box popups if the user profile already exist with a specific email or if they enter the email or password wrong to login. Added a page which is suppose to show up and greet the user as they logs on. Added a log off button to log out of their account.
