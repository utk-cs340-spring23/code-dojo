### What I accomplished
I created pages for both FAQ and About; I added javascript to give the FAQ questions collapse animations, and added some sample text about the project. I also added the sidebar that I created last sprint to both of the new pages to keep a matching look and updated its links with other pages to reflect moving the about page files to a new folder. The about button in the sidebar also didn't exist yet, so I modified it on all pages to include a link to 'About.'
