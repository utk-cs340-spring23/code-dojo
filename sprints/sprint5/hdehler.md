**Name:** Harrison Dehler
- **github id:** hdehler
- **group name:** code dojo

### What you planned to do
- Update the styling on the teacher page https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/114
- Fix player grid on the teacher page so that it extends downwards https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/115

- Position the timers on all pages to not move as the numbers change https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/123

### What you did not do
- I was able to get to all of my respected issues and fix what needed to be fixed front end wise. However, I wanted to find a way to make the sidebar look a little more up to date and modern, however, I did not get to that.

### File you worked on
- code-dojo/public/bigScreen.html
- code-dojo/public/bigScreen.css
- code-dojo/public/teacherPage.html
- code-dojo/public/css/teacherPage.css
- code-dojo/public/summary.html
- code-dojo/public/summary.css
- code-dojo/public/quizPage.html
- code-dojo/public/css/quizPage.css

### What you accomplished
- Fix timer styling on all of the pages to ensure that the boxes to no move as numbers change
- Update the player grid styling and funtionality. I made it so it extends downwards as players join, as well as styled the grid better
- Updated the teacher page styling to make the question fields a little more compact and look nicer
