- **Name:** Nagendra Upadhyay
- **github id:** nupadhy3
- **group name:** code-dojo

### What you planned to do
- I had planned to work on making some more changes to the front-end of the website to make sure it looked appleaing to the user. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/117
- I had also planned to make the summary page work correctly. https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/118
- I also tried to add a transition screen when the join button was clicked. I forgot to add an issue about it.

### What you did not do
- For this sprint we were able to finish all the things that we had planned to add to the website. I was not able to add the image transition when the join button is clicked as it was messing up the overall homepage of the website. As a result of those problems, we decided to drop that idea.

### What problems you encountered
- I did encountred a lot of issues with make the summary page as it had to be designed in such a way that it can easily be connected to the backend as the data had to be pulled from the server. I made a function which was able to keep track of a students answers and the question asked and the correct answer.

### What you accomplished
- I was sucessfully able to a finish my task of adding a summary page that would pop up on the student screen as the teacher clicks on the "Close Session" button. It works nicely and it was not very hard to connect it to the backend to pull up the data for the students. I was also successful in adding some colors and making the website look nicer.
