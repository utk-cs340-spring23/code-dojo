# Sprint 1
- Name: Harrison Dehler
- GitHub id: Hdehler
- Group Name: Code Dojo

### What you planned to do
- Design the home page https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/8
- Design the home page CSS https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/9
- Create a nav bar on the top of the home page https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/10
- Create a logo for the home screen (made two) https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/11
- Link pages for FAQ, About, Notes, History, Profile through buttons https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/17
- Make the sidebar buttons that fit the full width of the side bar https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/code-dojo/issues/18

### What did you not do
- I wanted to make it so that when you press tab in the side bar it does not tab you out of the text box
- Did not build the components to the about, or FAQ pages, I just made them.

### What problems you encountered
- Issues with linking an external font for the homepage

### Files you wokred on
- code-dojo/public/HOME_PAGE/homePage.html
- code-dojo/public/HOME_PAGE/homePage.css
- code-dojo/public/HOME_PAGE/mainPage.html
- code-dojo/public/HOME_PAGE/mainPage.css
- code-dojo/public/HOME_PAGE/teacherPage.html
- code-dojo/public/HOME_PAGE/teacherPage.css
- Created all of the pages and set backgrounds and linked them but thats it.


### What you acomplished
- I added the home page with a great asthetic with a blurred out picture of a dojo
- In the home page I added a top nav bar with hover css to make it look nice
- For the home page I created two logos that go with the name of our project that look nice
- Added a Session ID text box that is modernized with a nice button that has a hover style
- On the main page I implemented the the buttons in the side bar as well as linked them with their corresponding pages. I made it so that the buttons filled the width of the side bar which was challenging at first. I also added the same hover styling (you can tell I like that).
