The code is basically a website desinged with the help of HTML and CSS. In the HTML code, there is a navigation bar with a logo called "QuickLearn" on the left side, and three navigation links on the right side, which are Login, Join Room, and Contact Us. The links do not work, as I was just trying to design a very basic webpage. There are a few sections and divison in the code to separate the things. The right side of the page has an image. In the CSS code, there are styles applied to the different elements of the web page. Additionally, there are styles being used for background color, button hovering, and the shape. Lastly, there is a media query applied to the hero section, which adjusts the layout for smaller screens like smartphones. The website that I made can be useful as a home page for our project. You can see the website simply by running the html code in a live server or opening it.
