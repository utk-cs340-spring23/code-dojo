My program is a HTML website that is essentially and about me page. I included some CSS styling and
some features that I thought were cool.
I have a main page with a drop down menu called about me which has some of my interests.
I also have a picture of myself on there.
I then added a button that will take you to a new html page that contains some of my favorite pictures.
This language is going to be useful in our program becasue we are going to be making a website that we are going to be having our code-clicker software on where you interact.
I plan to figure out more about buttons and how to make them look better becasue I know they are going to be in our program, as well as the drop down that I made. That is why I created those in my helloplus.

In order to run this program I use a live browser and I suggest the same to anyone who may want to view my page.
